even more astonishing: certain diseases of the brain, like parkinson's disease, for example, could stem from the degeneration of our intestinal neurons. we could even treat the colon's inflammatory response to colitis, irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) stomach pains, and more. all these major gut health discoveries have revolutionized our approach to an organ that was previously considered to be dull and passive. the stomach's intelligence is fascinating research teams the world over as new research comes to light. explore the gut-brain connection and the key role it plays in our well-being.

nature deficit disorder is a recently identified syndrome of these conditions that manifests in an array of body aches, fatigue, non-restorative sleep and a poor immune system. this disorder is caused by people staying inside all day and wearing shoes at virtually all times, thus depriving themselves of the naturally-healing electrons that constantly flow from the surface of the earth.

synopsis

this documentary film analyzes the practice of making regular skin contact with the earth, like taking barefoot walks on the beach or on the grass or – better yet – swimming in natural bodies of water, which have been clinically shown to help heal chronic inflammatory diseases in 95% of all cases. all earthlings have this incredible healing power available yet most are completely unaware. start your free healing journey with gaia.

that's the message from the founding father of modern medicine and the controversial film food matters by producer-directors james colquhoun and laurentine ten bosch, who also directed the 2012 documentary hungry for change along with carlo ledesma.
with nutritionally depleted foods, chemical additives, and our tendency to rely upon pharmaceutical drugs to treat what's wrong with our malnourished bodies, it's no wonder modern society is getting sicker. food matters uncovers the trillion-dollar worldwide "sickness industry" that involves the healthcare, pharmaceutical, and food industries. discover scientifically verifiable solutions for overcoming illness via non-gmo organic foods or "raw foods."
in what promises to be the most contentious idea put forward, the filmmakers have interviewed several leading nutritionists and natural healing experts who claim that not only are we harming our bodies with poor food choices but that the right kind of healthy foods and detox supplements can treat chronic illnesses like heart disease.

this documentary film helps us rethink the belief systems fed to us by our modern medical and healthcare establishments. the interviewees point out that not every problem requires costly medical attention and reveal many alternative therapies that can be more effective and economical, less harmful and invasive than conventional medical treatments. realize the impact whole foods can have on your health, from weight loss to overall wellness.

as secrets go, this one's been well kept. officially, the knights templar was created in 1118, after the order took up residence on temple mount in jerusalem. but what if, a decade earlier, the templars were already active in another land two thousand miles to the west?, what if they were carrying out a covert exercise to create europe's first nation-state and there, established a kingdom within a kingdom?
all this in the one place no one has ever thought to look. could this be a cover-up or a conspiracy theory? you decide.

in this portion, richard interviews his old friend bill paxton.  he has a series of interviews with medium jennifer shaffer, and then during an interview with another medium (kim babcock), he asks a few of the same questions to see what the answers might be.  finally, with the help of dr. elisa medhus and her son erik (on the flipside) medium raylene nuanes answers the same questions asked by the other two to bill paxton. 

by using three different mediums to access the same person, this documentary shows that it's possible to speak to departed loved ones. while admitting there’s no way to prove he is speaking with his old friend, having three different mediums say the exact same things about someone they did not know and who is no longer with us, shows that while it's difficult to lose a loved one, we do learn they keep an eye on us from the flipside.">

david icke has been warning the public for almost three decades about the coming global orwellian state in which a tiny few would enslave humanity through new world order tactics. methods such as control of finance, government, media, and a military-police gestapo overseeing 24/7 surveillance of a microchipped population. he has said that “physical reality is an illusion" and that the "world" really is a holographic simulation created by a non-human force to lockdown human perception in ongoing servitude.

he has been subjected to decades of ridicule and dismissal over his theories. however, now his books are read all over the globe and his speaking events are watched by thousands. why? because what he foretold is playing out in world events and even some mainstream scientists are concluding that reality is indeed a simulation or "matrix."

people have all kinds of goals, from the simple to the difficult. ultimately, however, one goal supersedes all goals and also helps fulfill all of them. that is the goal of wholeness and holiness; perfection and angelifications. if wholeness, holiness is not your one goal, then what is? if a human can transform into an angel or illuminated being why do we resist this transformation? how can we tap into the powers of the light body?

it is said atlantis was a magnificent island in the atlantic ocean. sometimes — depending on the writer — it is moved to the mediterranean sea. sometimes people look for it in the bahamas or even egypt — any exotic location will do. in the great depths of the ocean, it has disappeared forever and within our history books, or so it seems.

many forget that we have one reliable source in plain sight. plato, the great greek philosopher, provided a detailed account of the ancient civilization around 360 b.c. plato’s atlantis is described as a utopian civilization made of concentric islands separated by wide moats and linked by canals. but how did it end up below sea level?

in this documentary, explorers george s. alexander and natalis rosen closely follow the ancient writings of plato. that is how they found the lost city of atlantis. by deciphering his writings, they uncovered evidence that links atlantis to a desolate area virtually untouched by modern man.

the idea conceived was to create a documentary film crowdsourced from practitioners of iyengar yoga from all over the world who would be given a chance to record their impressions of the impact that guruji and iyengar yoga have had on their lives, with the objective of gleaning different facets of the man and to weave a narrative to demystify him for future generations.

<div class="card" data-title="dharma rising" data-description="buddhism is now widely accepted as the fastest growing “convert” religion among educated westerners. there are reasons for its appeal: its comparative freedom from reliance on faith in dogmas that are hard to accept for pragmatic, scientifically inclined, westerners; its inclusive attitude to the natural world; its ecological approach to the notion of use; its compassionate, forgiving, and non-violent, nature. but its emergence in the west has presented the most difficult challenge in its 2,500-year history — adapting to modernity. 

the films looks through the eyes of the first generation of western dharma teachers at the myriad issues buddhism faces and how it is adapting within a culture that runs on the engines of competition and greed, where many consider cruelty to be kindness and ignorance to be knowledge.  but throughout its history buddhism has adapted to new cultures with almost chameleon-like ease. so if its past is any judge, the sublime path our colonial forefathers dubbed buddhism has begun a migration that over time will leave it, and quite possibly modernity itself, greatly transformed.">

while eastern traditions equate paradise with a higher ideal, in the west, it is often seen as a land tainted by evil and accessible only to the dead. distorted by translation errors and religious propaganda, such a view bears little resemblance to the original teachings. persian mystics, mayan shamans, ancient egyptian pharaohs, greek philosophers, and even knights templar made accessing paradise their life’s ambition, so what did they learn from their explorations? how were ancient temples and sacred sites designed to take human souls into a paradisiacal state? and if paradise is more than an imaginary otherworld, how and where can it be reached?
we welcome you to join this journey of self-improvement, starting in japan and ending, incredibly, in america’s capital.

<div class="card" data-title="caesar’s  messiah: the roman conspiracy to invent jesus" data-description="the origin of the christian religion has been a subject steeped in mystery for nearly 2,000 years. who was jesus? is he a historical character? who wrote the gospels? why are they written in greek? why did they have a pro-roman and anti-semitic perspective? why was the religion headquartered in rome?

seven of today’s most controversial bible scholars reveal their shocking conclusions about the origins of christianity. based on the best-selling religious studies book by joseph atwill, this documentary shows that jesus is not a historical figure: the events of jesus’ life were based on a roman military campaign, his supposed second coming refers to a historical event that already occurred, the teachings of christ came from the ancient pagan mystery schools, and the gospels were written by a family of caesars and their supporters, who left us documents to prove it. 

dissecting the history and literature of this time, the scholars show that the gospels are a sophisticated pro-roman multi-layered allegorical text that could not have been written by simple jewish fishermen. noting that the history officially provided by the church does not hold up to rigorous scrutiny, the scholars agree that christianity was used as a political tool to control the masses of the day, and is still being used this way today. much like the ancient era from which christianity emerged, we are currently on the brink of an immense paradigm shift, and studying this history can help us understand modern-day politics, and give us the much-needed perspective for coming up with solutions to today’s problems, in order to create the better world that we envision.">

<div class="card" data-title="solar revolution" data-description="does the sun have the power to transform humankind? in solar revolution, world-renowned german biophysicist dieter broers makes a compelling case, pointing to a wealth of scientific evidence that shows a remarkable correlation between increases in solar activity and advances in our creative, mental and spiritual abilities.

we are in the midst of a dramatic rise in solar disturbances, which have the capability of disrupting the earth’s geomagnetic field and, as a result, our global ecology. broers, however, sees this not as an impending apocalypse but as the dawn of a new era. drawing on research from a variety of disciplines, he shows how erupting solar activity carries the potential to boost our brain capacity and expand our minds in ways we never imagined possible. spiritual abilities now seen as extraordinary or supernatural—telepathy, extrasensory perception, and off-the-charts intelligence quotients—may soon become ordinary and natural and could very well help us solve the mounting global crises we are facing.

without a doubt, the way we think, feel, relate, communicate, and experience reality has been changing dramatically in recent years, and dieter broers assertsffirms those changes will ultimately culminate in a new form of consciousness and harmony on earth. humankind is going through an evolutionary leap, says broers, and the process has already begun.

directed by frank jacob, christian köhlert, and tonia madenford. starring: dieter broers, rupert sheldrake, michael persinger, ernst senkowski, illobrand von ludwiger

<div class="card" data-title="the face of birth" data-description="the face of birth - a film about pregnancy, childbirth, and a woman’s right to choose.

three years in the making, filmed across the globe from london to alice springs, the face of birth is a movie with vital information for anyone considering giving birth today. in 2009 it nearly became illegal to have a home birth in australia. three years later, in 2012, the number of women choosing a home birth has doubled! who are these women and why are the medical establishment and current birth culture so against them?

this empowering documentary follows the diverse, heart-warming, and sometimes heart wrenching stories of a handful of mothers as they guide us through the plethora of information and opinions facing mothers-to-be when deciding how, where, and with whom to give birth to their babies.

the film sorts fact from fiction in childbirth. it explores the politics of risk, safety, and fear, and exposes our mistrust of women in birth. from childbirth, to breastfeeding and maternity care - this documentary covers all the difficult choices women face during a pregnancy. the film also features many of the world’s top birth experts, including the famed sheila kitzinger (author of over 23 books on pregnancy and childbirth), and the founder of modern midwifery in the usa, ina may gaskin.

we hear from dr. rupert sherwood, (president, royal australian and new zealand college of obstetricians and gynecologists) whose college actively opposes home birth saying that it is ‘unsafe’. obstetricians euan wallace and andrew bisits (who have started up hospital home birth pilot programs) strongly disagree, claiming that modern obstetrics is not serving the best interests of women.

our diverse home birth mothers include afi award-winning actress noni hazlehurst. she’s known by one generation from playschool and another from city homicide, but do her fans know why she chose a home birth?

mother and doctor sara renwick-lau, chose a home birth for her second child after her first baby was delivered by emergency caesarean section at a maternity hospital in darwin, where she also worked. she claims her independent midwife gave much better care than her colleagues at the hospital.

young aboriginal mum tanya kunoth, from the remote community utopia in central australia, who had two babies in hospital and two babies in the country. she shares why it’s so important for her to be able to birth on her land, and why her home felt safer than in hospital.

beautifully filmed and openly revealing, the face of birth tells about all the things we never knew about birth and the power of choice.

natalie dowell mcintosh, with the support of her husband stuart, has literally transformed her life from a world heavily reliant upon medication and riddled with stress and anxiety to a life free of medication, with boundless energy and clarity. how ? simply by re-examining what they were eating and changing to a plant-based diet.

stuart mcintosh of raw food for life states, “we eat the same as our parents did. we create the same stressors in our lives. we tend to become replicas. what happens when you create the same environment and you have the same genes? you have the same outcome. but we do have the choice; it’s not just purely genetics and fate. we know that if we change the internal environment of our cells we can then start to expect a different outcome.”

natalie and stuart mcintosh of raw food for life have teamed up dr. michael klaper, dr. malcolm mackay, former vice-president of citibank philip wollen oam, world record-holding veteran athletes janette and alan murray, and others, to bring you this new documentary which shares the stories of people who have experienced profound health benefits through dietary and lifestyle changes, including overcoming cancer, illness and depression.

australians are increasingly living with lifestyle-related chronic diseases, health conditions, and health risks - with diet playing the largest role in the development of chronic illnesses. 
in 2014/15 - $161.6 billion was spent on health care, equating to $6,846 per person in australia. this is growing by $2.8% per year. strong research suggests depression and dementia are affected by the quality or our diet throughout our life. 

for more than 40 years, dr. michael klaper has served as a physician, consultant, and educator to thousands of clients and patients around the world on their journey to reclaiming health and optimizing well-being. when he initially changed his approach to medicine he recognized, lo and behold, the same wonderful changes began happening in my patients' bodies. they became leaner, their high blood pressures went down, their diabetes went away. it’s the food… it has been the food all along!

dr. malcolm mackay is a general practitioner with 30 years of experience in medical practice. he has a special interest in preventing and managing chronic disease with whole foods plant-based nutrition. many patients have conditions that are being fueled by the food they eat, and are suffering or are taking powerful pharmaceuticals to overcome the effects of the food”.
today food is consumed more for pleasure than nutrition, but what if we can learn how to satisfy our pleasure receptors with nutrient-dense plant foods? the good news is that, we absolutely can!” says natalie mcintosh. we show you how to easily replace even the strongest food addictions such as cheese and bread, with delicious health-giving alternatives."

- please be advised that although we feel there are important messages in this film, we also acknowledge that there may be conflicting ideologies that challenge beliefs. we like to encourage our viewers to do their own diligent research to determine which is the right approach for them as we regard nutrition and health as being highly individualized and not a ‘one size fits all’ approach.

fifty years later, there are tibetan buddhist meditation centers in every major city in the western world, and the dalai lama, the spiritual leader of tibet, has 17,000,000 followers on twitter. “everything has two sides,” tsoknyi rinpoche says in the film. “unfortunate side is we lost our country. fortunate side is dharma went all over the world.”">

microtopia explores how architects, artists, and ordinary problem-solvers are pushing the limits to find answers to their dreams of portability, flexibility, and of creating independence from “the grid”. modern nomads, homeless people, people in stress, people in need of privacy or seclusion - we hear about the personal reasons behind the dwellings and to see how they actually work. on the sidewalk, on rooftops, in industrial landscapes, and in nature we will see and feel how these abodes meet the dreams set up by their creators. microtopia deals with contemporary and urgent ideas that are addressed, and solved, in a very surprising way.">

our meat consumption has quintupled over the past 50 years. 65 billion land animals are being slaughtered every year for food consumption. one third of the global grain production is fed to animals for fattening, while 1.8 billion people worldwide suffer from hunger and starvation. can there really be a solution to all these problems?

it was the search for an answer to this question that led austrian author and filmmaker nina messinger on a journey through europe, india, and the us to investigate the consequences of our diet and to meet with leading experts in nutrition, medicine, science, and agriculture, as well as with farmers and people who have recovered from severe illnesses by simply changing their eating habits. the film's deeply distressing images and moving stories make a clear case for a plant-based diet that is not just a short-lived life-style trend, but provides a solution for preserving our entire world. the movie serves up a stunningly simple, yet comprehensive solution – right on our plates. changing our eating habits will rebalance not just our health, but the planet itself.

h.o.p.e. is a life-changing documentary, uncovering and revealing the effects of our typical western diet, high in animal-based foods. it contrasts the limited interests of the pharmaceutical and agricultural industry with the all-encompassing interests of living beings on this planet, and with the power of responsible consumer action. h.o.p.e. is an urgent call to action to all of us to commit to a change towards sustainability and safeguarding our living environment.

few people realize that the manufacturing process involves biotechnology and unsavory additives such as emulsifiers and flavor enhancers. but if these products are labeled “vegan” they can be sold for a much higher margin. keeping a vegan diet without knowing about nutrients in foodstuffs can lead to nutritional deficiencies and — in infants — even death. 

the interplay between small vegan start-ups, global players, major dairies with huge sales at stake, countries with a strong dairy-farming sector, legislation over genetically modified products — all of this makes us doubt whether we really are on the threshold of a new, sustainable diet. after all, the more mainstream vegan lifestyle becomes, the more profit-oriented manufacturers enter the game.">

<div class="card" data-title="milk: facts, figures & beliefs" data-description="for decades, drinking milk has symbolized a healthy diet. nutritionists around the world still advise regular consumption of dairy products. but is milk really as healthy as has been promoted? is it an essential product at all? or should we best avoid it completely? 

what we call milk has long stopped being the natural product that many people imagine. microbiologists, milk experts, and doctors explain the difference between traditional and industrial milk production. today, each high-producing dairy cow gives more milk than their four great-grandmothers put together. pesticides, hormones, antibiotics… we expose the absurd vicious circle: increased efficiency through concentrated feed leads to diseases, which are treated with antibiotics leaving drug residues in the milk. 

what we call ‘milk’ is not necessarily what we think it is. there are increasing concerns that milk may be the reason for allergies, intolerances, and even cancer. some scientists suspect that the processes of cooling, uht, pasteurisation, and homogenization degenerate proteins. all in all, it is the dose that makes the poison. and there are many indications that our “dose” of milk is an overdose.">

<div class="card" data-title="transgenic wars" data-description="the march towards the dominance of gm products in agriculture started 15 years ago, but where will it end? today, in argentina, all agriculture is transgenic, but after 15 years the weeds have adapted and glyphosate no longer works. in response, farmers have started using hazardous chemicals in an indiscriminate and unregulated manner. in some areas, the rate of serious genetic deformities in children has exploded. we meet the families and doctors convinced that living so close gm farms is the cause.
there is a one in two chance that the pork chop you had for dinner last night came from an animal that had been fed on transgenic soy. we visit the danish farms where both the amount of pigs born with deformities and the number dying from gastric diseases has dramatically increased. the animals are fed on a transgenic combo of gm soy that was treated with the herbicide glyphosate.
how has transgenic agriculture managed to conquer agriculture so quickly? while the u.s. government is beholden to the transgenic lobby, many european countries have managed to hold out. but how much longer will they be able to resist?">

<div class="card" data-title="the crispr revolution: genome editing" data-description="crispr enables scientists to alter the genomes of all living organisms faster, more economically and more precisely than ever before. “crispr will revolutionize medicine,” says pediatrician ronald cohn. he’s working in toronto on a new therapy that could save thousands of children from diseases long found incurable. 

crispr can also be used to give plants completely new characteristics: resistance against pests or drought. in the u.s. the first crispr plants are already in the fields. even some organic farmers see new opportunities in the innovative breeding method and have doubts whether the total rejection of genetic engineering they’ve espoused till now is still justified. 

others are warning about new dangers. they’re afraid of opening pandora’s box and interfering with evolution. the new technology, after all, could not only cure diseases and produce new seeds, but also create designer babies in the future. for the first time, genome interventions are possible, which until now have been merely utopian dreams or horror scenarios.">

as most plastic never deteriorates, it simply breaks down into smaller and smaller particles that are invisible to the human eye, what happens to this missing ocean plastic is a mystery. in this investigation, scientists embark in search of the micro-plastics. small, mostly invisible, and toxic, they are home to a new ecosystem: the plastisphere. but where are they? ingested by organisms? buried under the ocean floor? degraded by bacteria? and what is the impact of them entering the food chain?">
